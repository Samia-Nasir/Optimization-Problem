# Optimization-Problem

In this project we will solve a convex optimization problem using the following steps:
• The first step is to state the problem 
• In the second step we will formulate a mathematical model of the problem
• In the third step we will prove the problem is a convex optimization problem
• The next step is where we will formulate the Lagrange dual problem
• Next we will implement a method for solving the problem
• Finally we will solve an instance of the problem using Jupyter Notebook

All the steps are shown in the Jupyter Notebook file. The data used in this project is also given in Excel file.
